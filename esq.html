                <p>My name is Matthew Yang. I am a Grade 10 Extended French student at Waterloo Collegiate Institute with a passion for all things STEM and a dream of working in a computer science field. I am positive, hardworking, collaborative, a critical thinker, and a leader. In my spare time, I enjoy programming, playing chess, practicing guitar, learning advanced mathematics, and solving logic puzzles.</p>

                <h1>Education</h1>

                <p><b>Lester B. Pearson</b> was my elementary school. During grades 1-8, I was a full-time French Immersion student.</p>
                
                <p>From 2018 to 2021, I went to <b>Waterloo Area Enrichment Class</b>, an exclusive one-day-a-week program for gifted learners.</p>
                
                <p>Since 2021, I have been enrolled in <b>Waterloo Collegiate Institute (WCI)</b>'s Extended French Program. Currently, I am almost exclusively taking Pre-AP courses.</p>

                <p>I have also gone to <b>KW Chinese School</b> for the past 12 years. Every Saturday, I attend a 4-hour class to improve my Mandarin speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills.</p>

            <div class="about__content" id="stem">
                <h1>STEM</h1>
                
                <h2>Science</h2>
                <p>Science has been one of my favourite subjects since elementary school. In Grade 6, after making a presentation on black holes, I became obsessed with spacetime and general/special relativity. To this day, astronomy and physics remain my favourite branches of science. In Grade 11, I will be taking Physics (AP) and Chemistry (AP).</p>

                <h2>Technology</h2>
                <p>Technology has played a great role in my education and everyday activities. Technology allows me to learn, research, communicate, and game. I was always interested in how electronics (specifically computers) worked as a kid, and am currently taking Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies.</p>
                <p>During my elementary years, I was not very interested in programming, occasionally doing a bit of Scratch and Elm (McMaster's Outreach Program). My passion greatly grew during the pandemic, in the summer of 2020, when I took an online course for Python. In June of 2022, I began co-developing a custom discord bot for a server with over 700 members. I am currently learning C++, developing my own website (this one), and a weekly participant in WCI's Computer Science and Web Development clubs.</p>

                <h2>Engineering</h2>
                <p>My love for engineering began when my uncle bought me a KiwiCo subscription during the COVID-19 pandemic. Every month, I was sent a crate with instructions and materials for a unique and fun hands-on project. Last semester, I took Grade 11 Computer Engineering. I learned how to build PCs, create networks, and use many electrical components. During this course, I combined science with mathematics to construct complex circuits, and combined programming with engineering to build Arduino projects.</p>

                <h2>Mathematics</h2>
                <p>I love mathematics. In kindergarten, my sister decided (for some reason) to teach me how to multiply numbers, sparking my interest in mathematics and inspiring me to keep learning ahead. I improved my skills with Beestar from 2014 to 2016 and began learning more advanced mathematics on Khan Academy in 2016. For the past 6 years, I have attended Math Circles for higher grades at the University of Waterloo. I am currently a member of my school's Math Club and a regular participant in many CEMC math contests (Gauss, Pascal, CIMC, Cayley, Galois, etc.), consistently achieving distinction.</p>

                <h1>What Makes a Good Leader?</h1>
                <p>A good leader is someone who people look to for support. Leaders are reliable, respectful, positive, and logical. They are excellent listeners and communicators. Furthermore, good leaders are people with a vision. They can strategically plan and organize their team's activities, taking every member's strengths and abilities into account.</p>
                <p>Leaders also constantly encourage and check in with their group members. They are motivating, and rather than leading by force, their dedication, commitment, and ambition inspire others' contributions. They earn the respect and trust of the team, showing gratitude and empathy whenever necessary.</p>                                                                            
                <p>When resilient leaders inevitably encounter difficult situations, they are able to adapt and overcome these obstacles. Leaders actively enable and encourage teamwork for improved productivity and communication. They are also very courageous, being unafraid to provide feedback, make change, and take leadership in the first place.</p>
                <p>Overall, good leaders possess high intelligence, emotional intelligence, and open-mindedness. They can effectively create strategic plans, communicate and manage people, and accept different perspectives/ideas.</p>
